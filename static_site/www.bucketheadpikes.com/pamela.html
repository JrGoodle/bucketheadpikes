          <p>Starting a new recording project in October called &quot;Music In Pictures&quot;. Using the artwork of the 78 tarot cards to make 78 tracks of music based on Pamela Colman Smith's  artwork. This will be completed in October of 2025 in celebration of her life and her amazing artistry.</p>

                <td width="711"><p><strong>&quot;You ask me how these pictures are evolved,&quot; said Miss Colman Smith. &quot;They are not pictures of the music theme — pictures of the flying notes—not conscious illustrations of the name given to a piece of music, but just what I see when I hear music—thoughts loosened and set free by the spell of sound.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;When I take a brush in hand and the music begins, it is like unlocking the door into a beautiful country. There, stretched far away, are plains and mountains and the billowy sea, and as the music forms a net of sound the people who dwell there enter the scene; tall, slow-moving, stately queens, with jewelled crowns and garments gay or sad, who walk on mountain - tops or stand beside the shore, watching the water - people. These water-folk are passionless, and sway or fall with little heed of time; they toss the spray and, bending down, dive headlong through the deep.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;There are the dwellers, too, of the great plain, who sit and brood, made of stone and motionless; the trees, which slumber till some elf goes by with magic spear and wakes the green to life ; towers, white and tall, standing against the darkening sky—</strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>Those tall white towers that one sees afar,</em></strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>Topping the mountain crests like crowns of snow.</em></strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>Their silence hangs so heavy in the air</em></strong></p>
                  <p><strong><em>That thoughts are stifled.</em></strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;Then huddling crowds, who carry spears, hasten across the changing scene. Sunsets fade from rose to grey, and clouds scud across the sky.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;For a long time the land I saw when hearing Beethoven was unpeopled; hills, plains, ruined towers, churches by the sea. After a time I saw far off a little company of spearmen ride away across the plain. But now the clanging sea is strong with the salt of the lashing spray and full of elemental life; the riders of the waves, the Queen of Tides, who carries in her hand the pearl-like moon, and bubbles gleaming on the inky wave.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;Often when hearing Bach I hear bells ringing in the sky, rung by whirling cords held in the hands of maidens dressed in brown. There is a rare freshness in the air, like morning on a mountain-top, with opal-coloured mists that chase each other fast across the scene.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&quot;Chopin brings night ; gardens where mystery and dread lurk under every bush, but joy and passion throb within the air, and the cold moon bewitches all the scene. There is a garden that I often see, with moonlight glistening on the vine-leaves, and drooping roses with pale petals fluttering down, tall, misty trees and purple sky, and lovers wandering there. A drawing of that garden I have shown to several people and asked them if they could play the music that I heard when I drew it. They have all, without any hesitation, played the same. I do not know the name, but— well, I know the music of that place.&quot;</strong></p></td>
